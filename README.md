## Atomize Pro. 

Atomize Productivity (also known as 'Atomize Pro') is a productivity app designed to elevate the way you track goals and manage progress across all areas of life. Whether you're focusing on short-term tasks or long-term objectives, Atomize Pro helps you monitor and measure progress through diverse methods -- not just traditional checkboxes -- making your journey toward success more dynamic and engaging.
 
The front-end is built with vanilla Javascript, CSS, and React. On the back-end, Express keeps the server afloat and a PostGreSQL database holds all the user's stored data and preferences.

 
## Current Features

### Goal Creation:
Choose from four different templates to track your goal and your day's progress: 1) A check-list for simplicity and black-and-white outcomes, 2) A progress bar for meeting a specific number of units, 3) Sets for tracking repetitions of activities, and 4) A three-level block for measuring progress in stages.
  
### Set List Categories with Tabs:
Keep your goals organized in lists and stored under customized tabs for easy navigation and overwhelm prevention.

### An Aesthetically Pleasing Interface:
Interact with an interface that is pleasant to navigate and look at. Life is not an office and so it shouldn't feel like one when you're planning your next steps.
