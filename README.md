## Atomize Pro. 

 Atomize Productivity, aka. 'Atomize Pro.,' is a productivity app that aims to enhance the overall experience of goal-tracking and progress management for all spheres of life. Keep track of both short-term and long-term goals, and measure progress in a variety of ways, not just standard box-ticking.
 
 The front-end is built with vanilla Javascript, CSS, and React, but with improvements, will include features supported by libraries such as Dnd Kit. On the back-end, Express keeps the server afloat and a PostGresql database holds all the user's stored data.
